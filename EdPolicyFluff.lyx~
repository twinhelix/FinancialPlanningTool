Longevity Issues
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the analysis we assume that Jennifer will live to at least the age of
 75, after which we will use mortality tables in our simulations to determine
 how she should plan for retirement.
 The mortality tables change based on the gender of the individual.
 We choose to implement the 2010 valuation mortality table to perform our
 calculations.
 The sex field in the XML file allows us to select the correct mortality
 table.
 For Jennifer, our simulated life/death scenarios for after the age of 75
 are as follows:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to compute Jennifer's age distribution, we used Markov transition
 matrices calculating sample scenarios of Jennifer's age of death.
 The entries in the transition matrix tells us the probability that Jennifer
 will live to the next year given that she is already a certain age.
 We average 30 simulations per scenario to find Jennifer's longevity in
 each case while guaranteeing that she lives to at least 75 in every scenario.
 Once we know Jennifer's longevity, we can calculate the amount of wealth
 Jennifer bequeaths to her sister.
 One possible distribution of the wealth Jennifer passes on to her sister
 is given below.

\begin_layout Section
Retirement Plan Objectives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Maximize Probability of Funded Retirement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our primary goal is to assist Jennifer in saving for her retirement so that
 she can retire and maintain her lifestyle without worrying about future
 expenses.
 Ideally, with our guidance Jennifer will implement a strategy that fits
 her risk appetite and also steadily grows her retirement wealth throughout
 her career.
 On a very high level, we hope to maximize the probability that Jennifer
 achieves these goals and minimize her worrying along the way to a fully
 funded retirement at her desired retirement age.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Minimize Expected Retirement Delay
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ideally, we hope that Jennifer would be able to save enough to retire at
 68 years old in every single scenario.
 Unfortunately, there are instances where the market performance does not
 allow this to be the case.
 Our objective is to minimize the expected retirement delay Jennifer experiences
, given that she did not meet her target retirement wealth by the age of
 68.
 We can assist Jennifer in this regard through investment policy rules and
 through savings policy rules, by implementing an optimal policy corresponding
 to her level of risk aversion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Investment Policy Rules
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Fixed-Mix Rule
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A possible simple policy rule is to implement a strategy with a fixed amount
 of total capital in each of the three possible assets (cash, stock, and
 bonds) and with a fixed amount in the overlay commodities index.
 This rule can be good for long term investing, but does not take into account
 Jennifer's age or how close she is to attaining her goals.
 In this policy, we run our simulations and perform a maximization across
 them to find the highest average return applying the same weights to every
 year in each simulation.
 This method is particularly challenging because it is blind to the retirement
 account's growth and evolution through time.
 Ultimately, the strategy is too simple for Jennifer and will produce too
 much volatilty for her expected return.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Optimization:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When performing the Fixed-Mix strategy we constrain the volatility.
 In optimizing the strategy, we maximized the return across a variety of
 volatility constraints, ranging from 12% to 20%.
 We find the optimal volatility restriction to be 16%.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Variable Fixed-Mix Rule
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This policy is a slightly more complex version of the Fixed-Mix rule discussed
 above.
 The rule performs the same Fixed-Mix analysis to calculate the weights
 allocated to the various assets, but does so over smaller time intervals
 rather than the entire data set.
 For example, it optimizes over the next n years of simulations and then
 provides an optimal allocation for those n years.
 This strategy adds some variablility over the Fixed-Mix rule, but through
 our simulations produces generally the same weights for each time subset,
 with small deviations in the expected return.
 Our implementation of the rule changes the allocation every 10 years.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Bogle Variant Rule
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Bogle variant method would have Jennifer invest 100 minus her age in
 stocks and the remainder of her savings in bonds and cash (as well as the
 overlay).
 This rule is a simplistic way to have Jennifer invest more conservatively
 as she approaches retirement.
 This rule is superior to the two prior rules in that it incorporates Jennifer's
 current age and allows her to be more conservative as she approaches retirement.
 However, if Jennifer is not projected to reach her goal at a given date,
 placing more and more money into bonds will decrease her probability of
 reaching her retirement goal.
 We feel that this rule is overly simplistic as it does not allow Jennifer
 the upside potential of investing in stocks if she is falling short of
 her target retirement wealth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Capped Max Drawdown Rule
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The drawdown rule calculates the max drawdown over each simulated path and
 finds the average across these paths.
 The policy rule then maximizes weights in assets in the Fixed-Mix method
 while ensuring that the average maximum drawdown does not exceed our investor
 specified maximum drawdown threshold.
 Through the life of this investment policy, the investor enjoys the peace
 of mind to know that her retirement accound does not suffer large losses,
 though with these conservative investment weights the investor may not
 reach her goals.
 We recommend this policy for investors planning to save a large percentage
 of total salary each year, in addition to those who are particularly risk
 averse.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Optimization:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We maximize the return by testing maximum drawdown constraints ranging from
 16% through 25%.
 We find the optimal limit for the maximum drawdown is 20%.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Adjustable Risk Rule
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The adjustable risk rule increases weight in the highest volatility strategy,
 which in Jennifer's case is the stock allocation, when stocks perform below
 a specified threshold in the prior year.
 This strategy increases risk when the retirement account performs poorly
 hoping to capture higher returns and help the terminal wealth projection
 recover from losses.
 Additionally when the accounts see large gains, the asset allocation changes
 so that there is less weight in the risky stock index, thereby increasing
 Jennifer's probability of maintaining large gains for her retirement.
 We find that for investors with at least a moderate risk appetite, this
 policy rule can be quite successful, producing the highest probability
 of being funded for retirement of any rule presented here.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Optimization: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We optimize the size of the drawdown and the size of the allocation increase
 to maximize Jennifer's probability of reaching her target.
 We vary the allocation increase from 1% to 15% and the drawdown from 5%
 to 30% testing each combination and find that using the 10% drawdown as
 the threshold and increasing the allocation by 10% produces the maximum
 return.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Saving Policy Rules
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Account Allocation Rule
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each year, Jennifer must decide her allocation between her DC plan and her
 non-retirement savings account.
 This decision is largely tax based as Jennifer weighs the implications
 of paying a tax immediately versus paying taxes when she removes her money
 for retirement.
 With Jennifer's tax structure, she pays 30 % on the retirement account
 when she removes the money at retirement.
 For her non-retirement account, she pays a 30% tax immediately and then
 10% each year on returns (with a tax advantage on losses).
 As Jennifer's wealth grows in this scenario, she will repeatedly pay a
 capital gains tax on her non retirement account and will save all of her
 returns in the retirement account.
 Since the tax rate of both accounts is equal, Jennifer should place the
 maximum amount possible in her retirement account to minimize her tax exposure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Standard Savings Rule
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the standard savings rule, Jennifer wants to avoid all volatility in
 the total wealth of her accounts once she reaches her retirement age.
 At age 68, Jennifer keeps her wealth entirely in cash to avoid the volatility
 of the stock index and government bonds.
 Once age 68 passes, Jennifer's accounts no longer gain positive returns
 and decrease by the amount she spends each year.
 This rule is suboptimal as it does not take into account Jennifer's funding
 ratio throughout time or increasing her account balance after retirement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Prudent Funding Ratio Rule
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This method takes into account Jennifer's funding ratio and uses it as a
 metric to assess her asset allocation.
 As soon as Jennifer's funding ratio exceeds one (beginning with a 1.01 ratio),
 we assume that she will want to invest more conservatively to be more certain
 that she will reach her goals.
 We optimize the optimal funding ratio before immunizing the portfolio and
 find that though 1.00 produces the highest probability of Jennifer achieving
 her goals, the worst case scenarios with the 1.01 funding rule are superior
 to those with a funding ratio of 1.
 Taking Jennifer's worst case scenario into account we chose to use a funding
 ratio of 1.01.
 Once Jennifer's funding ratio reaches 1.01, her asset allocation is redistribute
d to be entirely in government bonds, which earn lower returns but with
 a lower variance.
 Since we assume Jennifer will work until she is at least 68 years old,
 immunizing her retirement wealth can be extremely advantageous and protects
 her against large losses that could force her to work beyond her desired
 retirement age.
 This strategy significantly improves Jennifer's probability of retiring
 at 68 years of age.

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:PrudentandAdjust"

\end_inset

 below juxtapose the standard savings rule with the prudent funding ratio
 policy.
 The retirement diamond of the prudent policy has been shifted left meaning
 the 80 percent confidence interval of Jennifer's age of reaching her funding
 goal occurs earlier in her career.
 Additionally, we see the target wealth before 68 is a function of time
 for the prudent policy, since the immunization places the total wealth
 into government bonds rather than cash.
 Therefore, Jennifer can realize her target wealth by meeting a target wealth
 threshold where immunizing into government bonds will allow her to reach
 her target with more certainty.

\begin_layout Subsection
The Contingent Spending Rule
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This particular allows Jennifer to readjust her spending appetite after
 recessions.
 We simulate across scenarios and find the worst 10% of stock market performance
s.
 In these cases Jennifer decides that her target wealth goal may be unrealistic
 and that she may need to adopt a slightly lower target in order to adjust
 for the market downturn.
 For these market crash scenarios, Jennifer readjusts her expectations by
 deducting 15% from her overall spending target for retirement.
 Through this method, Jennifer maintains realistic expectations, similar
 to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

worst case rule
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 implemented by Princeton University.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Comparison of Policies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The five different investment policies produce different returns and variances
 and present Jennifer with different benefits and drawbacks for her retirement
 investment.
 For each investment policy, we always implement the contingent spending
 savings rule, but have the chioce between the standard savings rule and
 the prudent funding ratio rule.
 With five investment policy choices and two savings policy choices we have
 a total of ten potential choices for Jennifer's optimal policy.
 We assume that the base policy is the Fixed-Mix saving rule.
 The Fixed-Mix policy rule selects a fixed allocation that maximized returns
 based on analyzing simulated scenarios.
 For example, suppose Jennifer selects the Fixed-Mix, prudent policy for
 her savings accounts.
 The distribution of Jennifer's wealth and savings as she approaches and
 hits retirement are given by Figures

From figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:StatisticComparison"

\end_inset

 we see immediately that there is a significant difference between the standard
 savings policy and the prudent savings rule.
 The prudent rule outperforms the standard rule across investment policies
 in terms of drawdowns, the probability of achieving the wealth target by
 age 68, and expected age when reaching the target wealth value.
 In terms of investment policies, the Fixed-Mix policy outlined above produces
 inferior results in every measured statistic but serves as a base policy
 upon which other policies build.
 The policy is inflexible and does not take into account Jennifer's age
 or drawdowns of the stock index in the optimal allocation.
 The variable Fixed-Mix policy is a natural extension of the Fixed-Mix policy.
 This policy is slightly more variable in that it allows allocations to
 change at a prespecified interval, but it still does not account for the
 drawdowns or Jennifer's age similar to the Fixed-Mix rule.
 The variable policy outperforms the Fixed-Mix rule as we would expect,
 but not by much as it adds minimal variability and does not improve on
 the major constraints.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can account for Jennifer's age by instituting the Bogle policy rule.
 This rule varies the allocation to the stock index relative to Jennifer's
 age but does not take into account drawdowns in the stock index or offer
 any flexibility in allocation.
 The Bogle rule performs very similarly to the Fixed-Mix and variable Fixed-Mix
 rules but is still inferior to other strategies.
 The first rule to incorporate the negative performace of the stock index
 in the maximum drawdown policy rule.
 The drawdown rule finds the optimal Fixed-Mix for Jennifer but constrains
 the maximum drawdown of the portfolio to a specified target level.
 Though ideal for a risk averse investor because of the reduced maximum
 drawdown, this policy rule is too conservative and does not take enough
 risk to achieve Jennifer's goals.
 The final strategy is the adjustable risk rule.
 By increasing the allocation to the stock index when the index performed
 very poorly in the prior year, the policy attempts to recover the losses
 suffered in the prior period.
 The policy rule is the most flexible and takes into account drawdowns,
 though it is oblivious to Jennifer's age.
 The combination of flexibility and responding to large drawdowns provided
 the best performance by far.
 The adjustable risk rule is described in detail above as we suggest the
 policy as the optimal choice for Jennifer to realize her retirement goals.
